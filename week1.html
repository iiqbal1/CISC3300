				<!-- Paragraph -->
			<center><p>The "As We May Think" article highlights many human advancements many take for granted. The exponential growth in data storage is often overlooked. Although we are making advancements are almost at our peek the physical field, the digital universe is still left to be discovered. The privilege of mass data storage allows us to easily access knowledge from thousands of years in a matter of seconds from anywhere with internet access. Even without the internet, we are allowed to compress information without hardly taking up space. The possibilities are endless as we have so many undiscovered possibilities. </p></center>

			<h2>Benefit with the use of science</h2>

			<ol>
 				<li>Increased  control of material environment</li>
 					<ul>Improved  food,  clothing,  shelter; increased  security and released  partly from the bondage of bare existence. </ul>
  				<li>Various media to record on</li>
  					<ul>Today we make the record conventionally by writing and photography, followed by printing; but we also record on film, on wax disks, and on magnetic wires. </ul>
 				<li>Machines perfordming complex arithmetical computations at exceedingly high speeds</li>
 				<li>There are machines for solving differential equationsâ€”and functional and integral equations</li>
 					<ul>There are many special machines, such as the harmonic synthesizer which predicts the tides. There will be many more, appearing certainly first in the hands of the scientist and in small numbers.</ul>
